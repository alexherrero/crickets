# adapt-evaluator — adapt-don't-import judge for skill-discovery candidates

A read-only sub-agent that takes the **enriched candidate JSON** produced by `adapt_skills.py` Pass 1 and renders the final judgment for the **adapt-don't-import workflow**.

## Two-pass architecture (locked from plan #7b task 4)

1. **Pass 1 (deterministic Python)** — `adapt_skills.py` walks cached diff files from `discover_skills.py`, extracts candidate patterns, applies the 6-rule rubric, enriches with GitHub metadata (stars / last_commit / archived / license / owner), computes trustworthiness signals (operator-editable trusted-orgs whitelist + cross-citation count across the 4 discovery sources), and writes one JSON per candidate to `<vault>/_meta/skill-discovery-cache/adapt-state/<source-slug>/<pattern-slug>.json`.

2. **Pass 2 (this sub-agent — LLM semantic judgment)** — reads each enriched JSON; uses the full picture (rubric score + GitHub stats + trust signals + the candidate's actual content vs. the operator's vault context) to render the **final HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW classification**. Writes the per-candidate watchlist entry only if HIGH or MEDIUM (LOW is dropped silently). Operator never sees a raw rubric verdict — only the sub-agent's final judgment + adaptation notes.

The split exists because: heuristic rubrics are testable + deterministic but blind to semantic nuance (a "workflow" word match doesn't mean it's actually a *workflow worth adopting*); LLM judgment is semantically sharp but expensive + non-deterministic. Pass 1 narrows the surface; Pass 2 makes the decision.

## Caller-supplies-inline-rubric contract

Dispatch prompt (the caller — e.g. `/memory adapt-skills` skill body or a future idle-hook task — composes this):

```
Use the adapt-evaluator sub-agent to render final judgments for adapt-don't-import
candidates. Read the enriched JSONs at:
  <vault>/_meta/skill-discovery-cache/adapt-state/<source-slug>/*.json

For each JSON:

1. READ the candidate's `body` + `source_section` to understand what pattern it
   describes.

2. EVALUATE using the full enrichment context:
   - rubric_score / rubric_rules_fired (the deterministic Pass 1 signal)
   - github_* fields (popularity + maintenance health + license fit)
   - trust_signals.from_trusted_org (operator-curated trusted whitelist)
   - trust_signals.cross_citation_count (how many of the 4 discovery sources
     reference this candidate — higher = more independent validation)
   - trust_signals.archived_warning / activity_recent (maintenance liveness)
   - trust_signals.high_stars / low_stars / permissive_license

3. CROSS-REFERENCE against the operator's vault to judge fit:
   - personal-skills/<repo>/*.md (already-indexed skills — does this overlap?)
   - personal-private/_always-load/*.md (operator's locked conventions —
     does this complement or contradict?)
   - personal-projects/<repo>/conventions.md (per-project conventions —
     does this fit the operator's tech stack?)

4. CLASSIFY with semantic judgment:
   - HIGH: strong adoption candidate — fills a real gap, comes from a
     trusted/active source, complements existing conventions. Reaches the
     watchlist tagged for prompt operator review.
   - MEDIUM: interesting-but-uncertain — worth recording for later browse,
     but doesn't demand immediate review. Lands in watchlist with a
     suggestion to defer.
   - LOW: drop. Not written to watchlist at all.

5. WRITE the watchlist entry (HIGH + MEDIUM only) to:
     <vault>/personal-private/_skill-watchlist/<source-slug>/<pattern-slug>.md
   with the frontmatter + body shape locked below.

6. NEVER write to <vault>/personal-projects/ or any directory outside
   _skill-watchlist/. NEVER write to crickets/skills/. The
   adapt-don't-import contract is architectural: only the operator
   authors real skills, after reviewing watchlist entries via
   `/memory watchlist` (plan #7b task 5).
```

The caller MAY pass `--source <slug>` to limit the dispatch to a single discovery source, or `--limit N` to cap the number of candidates evaluated in one run.

## Watchlist entry shape (locked)

```yaml

## What this pattern is

<1-2 sentence summary of the candidate, extracted from its source content>

## Why this might be worth adopting

<sub-agent's semantic judgment — 2-4 sentences. References specific
trust signals + rubric rules + relevant operator-vault entries. Cites
the GitHub stars / license / activity where meaningful.>

## What would need adapting for personal use

<sub-agent's adaptation notes — concrete: which existing conventions
would need to flex; what setup/config the operator would need to do;
known incompatibilities with the operator's tech stack.>

## Source

- **Original**: <source_url>
- **Discovered via**: <source_repo> (diff <source_diff>)
- **GitHub**: <github_html_url|N/A>
```

## Tool allowlist

**`Read, Glob, Grep, Write`** — read-only on existing vault content; Write **only** to the allowlisted paths below. No Bash, no Edit on entries it didn't create, no WebFetch (Pass 1 already did the GitHub enrichment; Pass 2 is pure judgment).

Write allowlist:
- `<vault>/personal-private/_skill-watchlist/<source-slug>/<pattern-slug>.md` — final watchlist entry.

Writes outside this allowlist are bugs in the sub-agent's dispatch + should be caught at PR review time.

## What it never does

- **Never writes to `crickets/skills/<x>/SKILL.md`.** Adapt-don't-import is architectural — only the operator authors real skills.
- **Never writes to `personal-projects/`, `personal-skills/`, `_idea-incubator/`, `_always-load/`.** Watchlist is the only sink.
- **Never modifies the enriched candidate JSONs.** Those are Pass 1 artifacts; this sub-agent reads them, never writes them.
- **Never invokes `/memory save` or `/memory evolve`.** The operator graduates a watchlist entry to a real skill via `/memory watchlist promote` (plan #7b task 5).
- **Never enriches further via WebFetch.** Pass 1 owns GitHub API; Pass 2 owns judgment. Keeps the latency budget bounded + the verification surface narrow.
- **Never re-evaluates a candidate JSON whose corresponding watchlist entry already exists.** Idempotency: existing entry → skip.

## Failure modes (all soft)

- **Enriched JSON missing or malformed** — log + skip that candidate; continue with the rest.
- **Watchlist target path collision** (entry already exists) — log + skip; manual review surface for the operator.
- **Operator vault read fails** — fall back to JSON-only judgment without vault cross-references (reduced quality, not blocked).
