"""The Obsidian/GDrive vault storage backend, behind the seam — re-homed into the plugin (V5-2).

This is the **re-homed** form of the V5-1 ``vault`` built-in: the same proven
backend logic, lifted byte-faithfully out of the agentm kernel into this
``obsidian-vault`` plugin's ``scripts/`` payload (V5-2, LC-1). It wraps the
existing vault write path (the V5-0 ``vault_mutex``/``content_hash``
CAS/``atomic_write`` routing) *behind* the part-1 seam, so the operator's live
vault keeps working — byte-unchanged, no data moved — now reached through
``resolve``/``read``/``write``/``list``/``exists``/``info``/``mkdir`` instead of
by direct file access. It registers under the ``vault`` protocol name in the
seam's default registry (mirroring how ``device-local`` registers at import).

During V5-2 the kernel built-in and this plugin copy run in **parallel** and are
proven identical (the V5-1 conformance suite + byte-identical parallel-run on the
operator's real vault). That green is exactly what lets **V5-3** delete the
*built-in* and leave this plugin copy as the sole vault backend. It is a **move,
not a rewrite** (LC-1) — do not let it absorb new vault behavior the built-in
lacks while both are live; divergence is what the conformance + parallel-run
gates exist to catch.

Design calls this module encodes (see the parent design, ``Status: final``):

  - **Wrap, not rewrite.** Reuse the proven V5-0 write primitives rather than
    reimplementing write-safety on live-data code — the lowest-regression path at
    the most dangerous moment of V5-1 (touching the operator's real store).
  - **The write path composes the FULL V5-0 stack** — ``vault_mutex`` +
    content-hash CAS + ``atomic_write``. This is the load-bearing difference from
    ``device-local`` (part 2), whose ``write`` composes ``atomic_write`` **only**
    (single machine — nothing concurrent, nothing synced). The vault is the
    multi-writer / GDrive-synced case the full stack exists for:

      * ``vault_mutex`` — the one per-vault advisory mutex (on a LOCAL,
        non-synced lockdir) serializes the *agentm fleet* — N≥2 concurrent agent
        sessions — so two writers never collide on the shared ``<target>.tmp``.
      * **content-hash CAS** — guards against a *non-mutex* writer: GDrive's sync
        daemon (or another device's sync) landing a remote change on the file
        between our pre-write read and the rename. The mutex can't see that
        writer — it lives outside the fleet — so the CAS re-read right before the
        atomic land refuses to silently clobber it (``ConcurrentModificationError``).
      * ``atomic_write`` — the crash-safe temp→fsync→rename; never an
        open-and-truncate, so an interrupted write leaves prior bytes intact.

  - **A synced, multi-writer capability profile + the whole-file conflict policy.**
    Unlike device-local's all-False floor, the vault declares
    ``concurrent_writers`` (the mutex makes N writers safe), ``sync`` (GDrive
    replicates the tree), and ``conflict_files`` (DriveFS surfaces
    "(conflicted copy)" files the engine must tolerate). It overrides the seam's
    ``conflict_strategy`` floor (``"none"``) to ``"whole-file"`` — *naming* the
    GDrive whole-file reconcile (DriveFS conflict files surfaced for
    operator-by-hand resolution by the existing ``detect_conflict_files`` +
    ``conflict-merger`` machinery), the policy part 5's selection reads. It is a
    name, not an executor — the backend ships no merge machinery; device-local
    stays ``"none"``.

  - **Depends only on ``vault_lock``, never the engine.** The seam sits strictly
    *below* the public memory API (DC-7); a storage backend importing
    ``harness_memory`` (the engine module) would invert that layering. So the CAS
    is composed here from ``vault_lock``'s own primitives (``content_hash`` +
    ``atomic_write``, the same pieces ``harness_memory.safe_write_replace_style``
    is built from) rather than by importing that engine helper. The error
    vocabulary is single-sourced: ``ConcurrentModificationError`` is imported from
    its canonical home, ``vault_lock``. The plugin **imports** the kernel
    ``vault_lock`` (LC-3); it never vendors a copy — the backend only ever runs
    under a present engine, so the single canonical write protocol stays single.

Locators map to paths exactly as ``write_state_file`` maps them: the backend is
rooted at the resolved per-project vault path (``<vault>/projects/<slug>``), and a
locator such as ``_harness/PLAN.md`` joins under it to
``<vault>/projects/<slug>/_harness/PLAN.md``. ``Locator`` guarantees the key is
normalized and carries no ``..`` (it raises ``InvalidLocatorError`` at
construction), so a key can never escape the root. Internal ``pathlib.Path`` use
is an implementation detail — every verb returns the seam's ``Locator`` / ``Info``
types, never a ``Path`` (the ``check-storage-seam-no-path-leak`` gate enforces it
statically over this ``storage_*.py`` module).

Unlike ``device-local`` (whose root is the fixed ``~/.agentm/memory``), the vault
backend has no universal default root — the per-project vault path is resolved at
runtime — so ``root`` is a required constructor argument. Part 5's selection
supplies the resolved path; the part-3 conformance suite and the composition
tests supply a throwaway scratch root (never the operator's live vault).
