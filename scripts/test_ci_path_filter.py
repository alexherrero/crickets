"""test_ci_path_filter.py — docs/wiki-only pushes must skip the light push-only
job; a mixed code+docs diff must never sneak through on `pull_request` either
(PLAN-ci-walltime-diet task 4; amended 2026-07-06, worktree-native flow /
PLAN-worktree-native-flow).

**2026-07-06 contract change:** the full 3-OS matrix + `ci-all` moved from
`push` to `pull_request` (crickets-conventions.md's ci-battery amendment).
A trigger-level `paths-ignore` on a REQUIRED `pull_request` check would mean
a docs-only PR's check never reports, which blocks that PR's merge forever —
so the docs/wiki diet is permanently NOT carried onto `pull_request` as a
trigger-level filter. It survives only on `push` for the 3 OS workflows
(which now run just the light `syntax`/no-op path on push) and disappears
entirely from `ci-all.yml`, which dropped its `push` trigger outright (the
aggregate only ever gated a PR merge, so it has no push-side job left to
skip). The diet returns as a job-level, diff-aware no-op INSIDE `ci-all`'s
`aggregate` job (`PLAN-per-plan-ci` task 1, `scripts/ci_diff_classifier.py`)
— filtering moves from "does this trigger fire" to "does this job's wait
step actually run once it has." See `test_ci_diff_classifier.py` for that
mechanism's coverage; the assertions below (no trigger-level paths-ignore on
`pull_request`, ever) are permanent, not an interim state to flip later.

Reads the real `paths-ignore` glob out of each test workflow's `on:` block and
replays it against two synthetic file lists: a docs-only diff and a mixed
diff, one code file among many doc files (must NEVER be classified skippable
anywhere — the guard is diff-based and conservative).

`matches_ignore_patterns` mirrors GitHub Actions' `paths-ignore` semantics for
the two pattern shapes this repo actually uses (`DIR/**` and `**/*.EXT`) — not
a general minimatch clone, which this codebase doesn't need.
