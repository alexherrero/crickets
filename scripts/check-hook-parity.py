"""Anti-recurrence guard: a developer-safety hook's `.sh` and `.ps1` twins must
stay behaviorally paired — neither may read a workspace-relative `.harness/…`
path without first resolving the workspace from the host's hook-input contract.

The bug this guards against (crickets v3.0 #40 follow-through): the `.sh` twins
were fixed to resolve the workspace root host-portably (read stdin JSON
`workspacePaths[0]` / `cwd`, fall back to `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, then cwd, and
`cd`/`Set-Location` in before any relative `.harness/…` logic), but their `.ps1`
twins were left doing bare cwd-relative checks. On a Windows / pwsh host — and on
Antigravity, which runs plugin hooks from the PLUGIN dir and passes the workspace
on stdin as `{"workspacePaths":["<root>"]}` — that made the `.ps1` hooks read the
wrong `.harness/` (or none). No gate compared the twins, so the divergence went
unnoticed for the whole window between the bash fix and its PowerShell follow-up.

This gate makes that divergence impossible to land silently again.

The heuristic (static + structural, per the plan's LDC-3)
--------------------------------------------------------
For every hook directory under `src/developer-safety/hooks/*/`:

  1. **Both twins must exist.** A `.sh` without its `.ps1` (or vice versa) is a
     parity hole by construction — the developer-safety trio is dual-host.

  2. **`references_harness ⟹ resolves_workspace`, per twin.** If a twin's *code*
     (full-line comments stripped — a doc-comment that merely mentions
     `.harness` or `workspacePaths` proves nothing) references a workspace-
     relative `.harness/…` path, that same code must also carry the two
     resolution markers:
       - `workspacePaths` — the host-contract protocol key. Naming-agnostic: it
         survives a rename of the resolver function (`_resolve_workspace` →
         `Resolve-Workspace` → anything) because it is the *only* way to read
         Antigravity's workspace, so any real resolver must reference it.
       - a directory-change verb — `cd` for `.sh`, `Set-Location` for `.ps1` —
         proving the hook actually moves into the resolved root before its
         relative logic runs.

This is the "at minimum" the brief asks for; full behavioral equivalence is the
job of the per-twin behavioral mirrors (`scripts/test_developer_hooks_workspace.py`
for `.sh`, `scripts/test_developer_hooks_workspace_ps1.py` for `.ps1`). The two
layers together — static parity everywhere this gate runs, behavioral mirror on
every CI OS — are the defense.

Known limitation (acknowledged, not a bug): the marker check assumes each hook
resolves the workspace *inline*. If a future hook factors resolution out into a
sourced/dot-imported helper, `workspacePaths` would not appear in the hook's own
body and this gate would flag a false positive — at which point the marker set
should learn the helper. The fixture tests pin the intended discrimination so a
loosening/tightening is a deliberate, reviewed change.

Stdlib only; text-level parsing on purpose (it asserts what the files say, not
what a shell/PowerShell parser normalizes them into).
