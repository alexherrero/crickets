# memory-recall-prompt-submit — inject query-relevant MemoryVault entries on prompt submit

A `UserPromptSubmit` event hook that takes the user's prompt as a recall query, calls the recall engine for top-K relevant MemoryVault entries, dedups against the entries already loaded by `memory-recall-session-start`, and injects the remaining matches as additional context before the agent processes the prompt.

## How it works

- **Trigger:** Claude Code's `UserPromptSubmit` event (matcher `.*` — fires on every user prompt).
- **Vault resolution:** reads `MEMORY_VAULT_PATH` env var. If unset, exits 0 silently (no-op — the hook never breaks a session where MemoryVault isn't configured).
- **Input:** stdin JSON from Claude Code with at minimum a `prompt` field (the user's submitted text).
- **Recall query:** prompt text → recall engine → top-K relevant entries (default K=5).
- **Dedup:** entries with paths matching the always-load set (loaded by `memory-recall-session-start`) are dropped — no redundant injection.
- **Output:**
  - **stdout** — formatted markdown block: a header line + each entry's body (frontmatter stripped) separated by `---` rules. Claude Code injects this as additional context before the agent sees the prompt.
  - **stderr** — one transparency line: `[memory-recall-prompt-submit] Loaded N relevant entries: <slug-list>` (shown to operator in hook logs).
- **Time budget:** 300ms wall clock. On overrun: log a warning to stderr, return the partial results gathered so far (degraded-graceful). The hook never blocks the user prompt.
- **Exit 0** always (unless a Python interpreter error — vault / engine problems are warnings, not failures).

## Implementation status (task 2 of plan #7a part 2)

This task ships the **hook scaffold** — the hook installs at its host destination + the settings-fragment merges + the shell wrappers run cleanly + stdin is parsed + the transparency line is emitted. The **recall engine** (sqlite-vec query + grep+frontmatter parallel + rank-merge) lands in task 3 of this part. Until then, the `prompt-submit` subcommand of `recall.py` returns an empty result set + a placeholder transparency line `[memory-recall-prompt-submit] (scaffold — recall engine lands in task 3)`. The hook contract is stable; only the engine logic is incremental.

## What it never does

- **Never blocks the user prompt.** If anything fails (vault missing, Python missing, recall engine errors), the hook exits 0 and the agent processes the prompt as-is.
- **Never injects duplicate context.** Always-load entries already in the session context are filtered out of the recall results by path.
- **Never reads `_archive/` or `_inbox/` by default.** `_archive/` is always excluded; `_inbox/` is excluded unless a future `--include-inbox` flag is set (deferred to manual `/memory search` in plan #7a part 3+).
- **Never surfaces `status: superseded` entries.** Filtered by default.
- **Never writes to the vault.** Pure read-only.

## Failure modes (all soft)

- **`MEMORY_VAULT_PATH` unset:** exits 0 with no output.
- **Vault path doesn't exist:** stderr warning + exit 0.
- **Stdin not valid JSON or `prompt` field missing:** stderr warning + exit 0 (graceful — the agent still gets the prompt).
- **Recall engine raises (any reason):** stderr warning + exit 0 with empty injection (degraded-graceful — agent processes prompt without memory context this turn).
- **Time budget exceeded mid-recall:** stderr warning naming the budget overrun + partial results emitted + exit 0.
- **Python unavailable:** the shell wrapper exits 0 silently.

## Antigravity equivalent

Antigravity has no first-class hook surface (per the v0.7.0 installer reality). The equivalent pattern there is a **per-prompt skill auto-invocation** — a skill that triggers on every prompt + queries the recall engine. That skill is **not shipped in this hook directory** — it's a future companion customization tracked under MemoryVault's discovery-mining part.
