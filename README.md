Personal collection of agent customizations — skills, sub-agents, hooks, MCP servers, slash commands, bundles, and more — across Claude Code, Antigravity, and Gemini CLI. Sibling repo to [`agentic-harness`](https://github.com/alexherrero/agentic-harness): the harness owns phase-gated workflow, this toolkit owns the customizations that ride on top.

## What's inside (v0.1.0)

Three skills + one reference bundle:

| Customization | Kind | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`pii-scrubber`](skills/pii-scrubber/SKILL.md) | skill | Agent-facing PII guardrail — scans the current git diff before commit/push, presents findings, offers redactions. Companion to the pre-push hook. |
| [`dependabot-fixer`](skills/dependabot-fixer/SKILL.md) | skill | Fix breakage on a Dependabot PR. Reads failing CI logs, applies a bounded fix loop, pushes commits to the Dependabot branch, comments residual risks. Never merges. (Migrated from agentic-harness v1.x.) |
| [`ship-release`](skills/ship-release/SKILL.md) | skill | Cut a tagged GitHub release with semver-driven version bumps from conventional commits. Writes CHANGELOG, tags, pushes, creates the release. (Migrated from agentic-harness v1.x.) |
| [`example-bundle`](bundles/example-bundle/bundle.md) | bundle | Reference skeleton showing how to package a multi-primitive customization. Safe to delete in your fork. |

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    M[Your manifest<br/>YAML frontmatter:<br/>name · kind · supported_hosts]
    I[install.sh<br/>per-host dispatch]
    C[.claude/skills/&lt;name&gt;/]
    A[.agent/skills/&lt;name&gt;/]
    G[.agents/skills/&lt;name&gt;/]
    H[.git/hooks/pre-push<br/>PII guardrail]

    M --> I
    I --> C
    I --> A
    I --> G
    I --> H
```

One manifest, three host destinations. The installer reads each customization's `supported_hosts` and dispatches to the right paths per kind (see [wiki/reference/Per-Host-Paths](wiki/reference/Per-Host-Paths.md)).

## Install

```bash
# Clone as a sibling of agentic-harness (recommended layout)
cd ~/Antigravity
git clone https://github.com/alexherrero/agent-toolkit.git

# Drop all customizations into a target project (default — installs everything + pre-push hook)
bash ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/install.sh /path/to/your-project

# Or install only one bundle / skill:
bash ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/install.sh --bundle example-bundle /path/to/your-project
bash ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/install.sh --skill pii-scrubber /path/to/your-project

# Refresh (true-sync — wipe + recreate managed dirs):
bash ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/install.sh --update /path/to/your-project
```

On Windows / PowerShell 7+:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File C:\path\to\agent-toolkit\install.ps1 C:\path\to\your-project
```

## PII guardrails (foundational)

This repo is **public** and holds personal customizations. Three enforcement layers protect against personal information leaking into commits:

1. **Pre-push git hook** (`templates/hooks/pre-push`) — installed by the toolkit's installer into target projects' `.git/hooks/pre-push`. Runs `check-no-pii.sh` against every push; blocks non-zero. **Mandatory enforcer.**
2. **`pii-scrubber` skill** — agent-facing interactive layer. Scans the current diff, presents findings, offers redactions interactively.
3. **CI gate** — `check-no-pii.sh --all` + the official `gitleaks-action` run on every push to GitHub.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the override protocol.

## Status

Actively evolving. Releases and release notes are the source of truth — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and the [latest release](https://github.com/alexherrero/agent-toolkit/releases/latest).

## Contributing

Self-tested on every push by three per-OS workflows (Linux, Mac, Windows). Run the same gates locally:

```bash
bash scripts/smoke-install-bash.sh
python3 scripts/validate-manifests.py
bash scripts/check-syntax.sh
bash scripts/check-lib-parity.sh
bash scripts/check-no-pii.sh --all
```
