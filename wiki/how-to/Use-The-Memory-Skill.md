# How to use the memory skill

> [!NOTE]
> **Goal:** capture durable preferences / workflows / fixes to MemoryVault so the agent's behavior compounds across sessions. Evolve entries when preferences change without losing the audit trail.
> **Prereqs:** `agent-toolkit` installed (skill lands at `.claude/skills/memory/` + `.agent/skills/memory/`); an Obsidian vault folder set up as your `MemoryVault/` root + the path exported as `MEMORY_VAULT_PATH` (or passed via `--vault-path` on each invocation). Python deps (`pyyaml`, `sqlite-vec`, `sentence-transformers`) install by default when you run `bash install.sh ~/your-project` — opt out with `--no-python-deps` if you manage Python deps yourself. Without `sentence-transformers` the skill still works (file writes always succeed; embedding queues for later; recall degrades to grep+frontmatter-only). **v0.9.2 (2026-05-20): local `sentence-transformers` is now the only embedding mode** — see [ADR 0001's 2026-05-20 amendment](../explanation/decisions/0001-agent-toolkit-purpose.md#amendment-2026-05-20). The previous Voyage/Anthropic API mode + `MEMORY_USE_API_EMBEDDINGS` env var were removed.

The `memory` skill ships as plan #7a parts 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 of [MemoryVault — Permanent agent memory via Obsidian-vault-folder + reflection sidecar](../explanation/designs/memoryvault.md). This page covers the **two write primitives** (`/memory save` + `/memory evolve`), the **two recall hooks** (SessionStart + UserPromptSubmit), the **`/memory reflect` skill + Stop / idle reflection hooks** (the write loop), **crash-recovery markers**, and the **two-tier idea ledger** (`Ideas.md` surface + `_idea-incubator/` deep research + `/memory promote` graduation + GC). Discovery-mining + seed-pass come in subsequent parts.

## Scenario 1 — Save a new preference

Capture a dev-flow convention you want the agent to follow forever:

```bash
echo "Status:[x] task closeouts in PLAN.md must be paragraph-long narratives,
not just checkmarks. The next session's context is whatever the closeout
captures — so capture everything that matters: files changed, design calls,
scope adjustments, CI per-OS times, manual verification scenarios, negative
test results when relevant." \
| python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/save.py \
  preferences paragraph-long-status-narratives \
  --vault-path ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-<account>/My\ Drive/Obsidian/MemoryVault \
  --tags dev-flow,status-reports,locked-design-call \
  --always-load
```

Or via Claude Code (the agent invokes the skill's documented flow using `Read` / `Write` / `Edit` tools — byte-identical output):

```
/memory save preferences paragraph-long-status-narratives \
  --always-load \
  --tags dev-flow,status-reports,locked-design-call
```

The file lands at `MemoryVault/personal-private/_always-load/paragraph-long-status-narratives.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
kind: preferences
status: active
created: 2026-05-17
updated: 2026-05-17
tags: [dev-flow, status-reports, locked-design-call]
group: personal-private
slug: paragraph-long-status-narratives
always_load: true
---
```

Followed by the body content.

The `--always-load` flag routes the entry to `_always-load/` (regardless of `--group`) and sets `always_load: true` so future recall hooks inject it at SessionStart.

## Scenario 2 — Evolve a preference when you change your mind

Three months later you decide bulleted lists work better than paragraphs for status reports. Use `/memory evolve` to preserve the audit trail:

```bash
echo "Status:[x] task closeouts in PLAN.md use bulleted lists per task:
- files changed (count + key paths)
- design calls (locked decisions only)
- CI per-OS times (Linux / Mac / Windows)
- manual verification scenarios (if applicable)
- negative-test results (if applicable)
Each bullet 1-2 sentences max." \
| python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/evolve.py \
  personal-private/_always-load/paragraph-long-status-narratives.md \
  "Switched preference: bulleted lists scale better; paragraph format was hard to scan when reviewing PLAN archives" \
  --vault-path ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-<account>/My\ Drive/Obsidian/MemoryVault
```

After:

- **Active entry** at the original path now contains the new bulleted preference. Its frontmatter gains `supersedes: personal-private/_archive/personal-private/_always-load/paragraph-long-status-narratives.md.20260817.md`.
- **Archive entry** at `personal-private/_archive/personal-private/_always-load/paragraph-long-status-narratives.md.20260817.md` contains the original body (unchanged) plus updated frontmatter: `status: superseded`, `superseded_by: <new-path>`, `superseded_at: 2026-08-17T...Z`, `superseded_reason: "Switched preference: bulleted lists scale better..."`.

The recall engine (lands in plan #7a part 2) skips `status: superseded` entries by default, so the agent picks up the new preference automatically. The archive stays for human-review of the supersession history.

## Scenario 3 — Rename an entry while evolving

The slug `paragraph-long-status-narratives` no longer fits the new preference. Use `--new-slug` to rename:

```bash
echo "New content for renamed entry..." \
| python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/evolve.py \
  personal-private/preferences/paragraph-long-status-narratives.md \
  "Renamed to reflect new bulleted format" \
  --new-slug bulleted-status-narratives \
  --vault-path ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-<account>/My\ Drive/Obsidian/MemoryVault
```

The old entry is unlinked from its original path; a new entry appears at `<old-parent>/bulleted-status-narratives.md` with `supersedes:` cross-link to the archive. The archive contains the old body + slug, frozen at the evolution moment.

**Note**: `--new-slug` is rejected for `_always-load/` entries — those evolve in place only (the directory structure under `_always-load/` is flat by convention).

## Auto-recall via the two-hook pattern

Two Claude Code hooks install alongside the memory skill and run automatically — no command needed. They form the **recall side** of MemoryVault: the agent sees relevant entries from your vault without you having to surface them.

### SessionStart hook

Fires once per session boot (also on resume / clear / compact). Globs every entry under `<vault>/personal-private/_always-load/*.md` and injects their bodies into session context. A single transparency line on stderr names what got loaded:

```
[memory-recall-session-start] Loaded 3 MemoryVault always-load entries: paragraph-status, commit-trailer, release-pair-order
```

**Hard time budget**: 500ms wall clock. On overrun: emits partial results + warning, exits 0 (never blocks session boot). Filtering invariants: entries with `status: superseded` are skipped.

### UserPromptSubmit hook

Fires on every user prompt. Takes the prompt as a recall query, runs the **5-step recall engine**, dedups results against the always-load set (no redundant context), and injects up to K=5 matches as additional context before the agent processes the prompt:

```
[memory-recall-prompt-submit] Loaded 2 relevant entries: evolve-pattern, supersedes-cross-link
```

**Hard time budget**: 300ms wall clock. Same degraded-graceful contract as SessionStart.

### Recall engine — 5 steps

1. **Tokenize the query** — lowercase + alphanumeric runs + drop tokens shorter than 3 chars.
2. **Vec search** — embed the query (via the configured mode — see Embedding modes below) + sqlite-vec MATCH query for top-k by cosine similarity.
3. **Grep + frontmatter scan** in parallel — count distinct query tokens appearing in `slug + tags + body[:500]` per entry; filter `status: superseded`; exclude `_archive/` always + `_inbox/` by default.
4. **Merge** — combined score = `sim × 0.7 + keyword_match_count × 0.3` (locked weights; tune from real use per Tech Debt #7).
5. **Dedup + top-K** — drop entries that match the always-load set (already injected), sort by combined-desc, return top-K (default 5).

**Degraded-graceful chain** — any failure falls back rather than blocking:
- sqlite-vec not installed → grep-only recall.
- No API key set + no local sentence-transformers → grep-only recall.
- Vec-index empty → grep-only recall.
- Time budget exceeded → partial results + warning.

### Manual recall (operator debug)

Run the engine directly from the shell. JSON-Lines output is pipeable for scripting:

```bash
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/recall.py \
  --vault-path ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-<account>/My\ Drive/Obsidian/MemoryVault \
  query "how do I evolve a memory entry" -k 3
```

Output (one JSON record per line):

```json
{"path": "personal-private/workflow/evolve-pattern.md", "slug": "evolve-pattern", "sim": 0.73, "keyword": 3, "combined": 1.411}
{"path": "personal-private/preferences/supersedes-cross-link.md", "slug": "supersedes-cross-link", "sim": 0.52, "keyword": 2, "combined": 0.964}
```

Useful for tuning the merge weights, debugging "why didn't this entry surface", or composing manual searches before `/memory search` lands as a first-class skill sub-command (deferred to a future plan).

Flags:
- `-k N` — top-K (default 5).
- `--budget-ms N` — time budget override (default 300ms).
- `--include-inbox` — surface `_inbox/` entries too (default excluded — those are raw, unfiltered candidates).
- `--mode local|stub` — embedding mode override (default: `local`; `stub` is testing-only). `--mode api` was removed in v0.9.2 — see [ADR 0001 amendment](../explanation/decisions/0001-agent-toolkit-purpose.md#amendment-2026-05-20).

### Antigravity equivalent

Antigravity has no first-class hook surface as of v0.9.0, so the SessionStart + UserPromptSubmit hooks land on Claude Code only. The functional equivalent for Antigravity is a future **always-on rule** that reads from `_always-load/` at agent boot + a per-prompt skill auto-invocation — tracked under MemoryVault's discovery-mining part. The recall engine itself (`recall.py`) is host-agnostic and exposed via the CLI today; Antigravity skills can shell out to it directly.

## Reflection sidecar — Stop + idle + manual

Three trigger surfaces run the **same mining logic** in `skills/memory/scripts/reflect.py`. Together they form the **write loop** — distinct from the recall side documented above.

### Mining algorithm

Each trigger reads a Claude Code session transcript (at `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl`) and runs two parallel mining passes:

- **3-category memory mine**: scans user + assistant messages for explicit user preferences (`always X` / `never Y` / `I prefer Z` / `use X not Y` patterns → **HIGH** confidence), user corrections (`no, that's wrong` / `you should have X` patterns → **MEDIUM**), fixes & workarounds (`fixed by X` / `resolved by Y` / `workaround` patterns → **MEDIUM**), and workflow patterns (any tool used 3+ times → **MEDIUM**).
- **Idea-candidate mine**: scans for forward-looking statements (`we should also` / `later we could` / `follow-up` / `could be its own` patterns).

Each mined candidate gets full instrumentation per Tech Debt #7: category + confidence + slug suggestion + title + body + rationale (which pattern matched) + verbatim excerpts (windowed ±80 chars) + occurrences count. The rationale + excerpts make `/memory inspect` (future plan) the auditing surface for "why did this candidate surface?".

### Tri-modal routing — 3 modes

After mining, candidates route per **confidence tier** + selected mode:

| Mode | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | Idea |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `auto` (default; hook-safe) | canonical save | `_inbox/` | `_inbox/` | `_inbox/` |
| `silent` | canonical save | canonical save (auto-approve) | `_inbox/` | `_inbox/` |
| `interactive` | canonical save | stdin prompt (approve / reject / skip / inbox) | `_inbox/` | `_inbox/` |

Mode resolution: `--route-mode` CLI flag → `MEMORY_REVIEW_MODE` env var → default `auto`. `interactive` mode falls back to `auto` when stdin isn't a TTY (preserves the never-block-the-hook contract).

### Trigger 1: manual `/memory reflect`

User-invokable; runs against the current Claude Code session by default or an arbitrary transcript path via `--session`. Useful for dogfooding new patterns, re-running over an old session, or doing on-demand triage:

```bash
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/reflect.py \
  ~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl \
  --summary --route --route-mode interactive
```

`--summary` prefixes a 1-line summary record; `--route` enables the routing pass (requires `--vault-path` or `MEMORY_VAULT_PATH`). Without `--route`, the script just emits candidates on stdout for inspection.

### Trigger 2: Stop-event hook (`memory-reflect-stop`)

Auto-installed at `.claude/hooks/memory-reflect-stop.sh`. Fires on Claude Code's `Stop` event (end of each agent turn). Parses the Stop payload for `session_id` + `cwd`, resolves the transcript path, invokes `reflect.py --route`, emits a transparency line on stderr:

```
[memory-reflect-stop] Mined 3 memory + 1 idea candidates from <transcript-path>; saved 1, inboxed 3
```

Coexists with `commit-on-stop` (both register on the Stop event). Hook context has no TTY, so the `interactive` mode falls back to `auto` automatically. Never blocks session end — graceful-skip exhaustively across missing reflect.py / no session_id on stdin / transcript missing / MEMORY_VAULT_PATH unset.

### Trigger 3: idle-time hook (`memory-reflect-idle`)

Auto-installed at `.claude/hooks/memory-reflect-idle.sh`. **First new agent-toolkit hook primitive** — Claude Code has no native "idle" event, so this hook fires on `SessionStart` instead (alongside `memory-recall-session-start`) and scans `.harness/session-id-*.start` markers for orphans (markers older than 1 hour = sessions where Stop didn't fire — Claude Code crashed / kill -9 / force-quit). For each orphan, it invokes `reflect.py --route` retroactively, renames `.start` → `.reflected` on success. Also GCs `.reflected` markers older than 30 days.

Three convergent trigger surfaces give layered coverage:

1. **SessionStart event** (auto, every session boot): catches the common "operator returned after break" case.
2. **Manual invocation**: `bash .claude/hooks/memory-reflect-idle.sh` for on-demand orphan sweep.
3. **Cron / launchd / scheduled task** (operator-installed; opt-in for aggressive coverage): example crontab — `*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/project; bash .claude/hooks/memory-reflect-idle.sh`.

Idle threshold + GC threshold are env-overridable: `MEMORY_IDLE_THRESHOLD_SEC` (default 3600) + `MEMORY_REFLECTED_GC_SEC` (default 2592000).

## Crash-recovery markers

Locked design call B2.ii: every session writes a `.harness/session-id-<uuid>.start` marker at SessionStart; Stop hook renames it to `.reflected` after successful reflection. The marker format is plain text (not JSON — operator-debuggable by hand):

```
session_id: <uuid>
started_at: <iso-8601-utc>
transcript: <absolute-path-to-jsonl>
```

If Stop doesn't fire (crash, kill -9, force-quit), the `.start` marker stays — the next SessionStart triggers the idle hook, which scans for `.start` markers older than the idle threshold, runs `reflect.py --route` retroactively, and renames them. No agent observation lost across crashed sessions.

Markers live in `.harness/` (gitignored — runtime metadata only; no PII / transcript content). The idle hook's 30-day GC keeps the directory bounded without operator intervention.

## Idea ledger — two-tier capture

When the reflection sidecar surfaces an **idea candidate** (forward-looking statement: `we should also`, `later we could`, `follow-up`, `could be its own project`), the idea-ledger system writes it to **two destinations** — one for human reading + one for agent recall:

### Tier 1 — Surface (`~/Obsidian/Ideas.md`)

A single append-only file at the user's Obsidian vault root. Each idea gets a section:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD: <Idea Title>
<2-sentence summary>
See deep research: [[MemoryVault/personal-private/_idea-incubator/<slug>/_index.md]]
```

The wikilink resolves in Obsidian — clicking it opens the deep-research dir. Sections accumulate sorted by date-prefix; the file is the operator's surface for "what ideas have surfaced over time?".

**Lives OUTSIDE MemoryVault** — at `~/Obsidian/Ideas.md` by default. Override via `IDEAS_SURFACE_PATH` env var if the operator's Obsidian vault root is elsewhere.

### Tier 2 — Deep research (`_idea-incubator/<slug>/`)

An incubator directory inside MemoryVault with 4 files per idea:

```
_idea-incubator/<slug>/
├── _index.md                # frontmatter + agent reasoning + cross-refs
├── research-pending.md      # placeholder for memory-idea-researcher sub-agent
├── related-memoryvault.md   # placeholder for cross-ref scan
└── related-obsidian.md      # placeholder for Obsidian-notes scan
```

`_index.md` frontmatter is locked: `kind: idea / status: incubating / slug / surfaced_at / surfaced_in_session / research_budget_*`. Body has surface summary + agent reasoning (rationale + supporting transcript excerpts) + deep-research status + budget table + promotion/GC explanation.

**Research budget caps** (locked design call B1.i):

| Cap | Default | Override |
|---|---|---|
| Wall-time | 300s | `--budget-wall-time-sec N` |
| Web fetches | 3 | `--budget-web-fetches N` |
| Tokens (in+out) | 5000 | `--budget-tokens N` |

The `memory-idea-researcher` sub-agent enforces these via timeouts; budget overrun produces partial results + a `research_status: partial` frontmatter flag. Never blocks the calling session.

### A3 permeable-write-boundary

Writes to `~/Obsidian/Ideas.md` are outside MemoryVault — first-class consumers of the **A3 locked design call** (permeable write boundary). Every cross-boundary write goes through `permeable_boundary.confirm_write_outside_memoryvault()`:

- **Reflection-driven** (agent-initiated): mode `interactive` (default) → prompts the operator with target path + content preview + rationale; default action is **deny** (safer); explicit `y`/`yes` approves.
- **Direct user invocation** (explicit request — future `/memory idea` command): mode `silent` typically passes since the operator already requested the write.
- **Hook context** (non-TTY): mode `auto` → **denies** unconditionally. Never silent writes outside MemoryVault from non-interactive contexts.
- **Override**: set `MEMORY_REVIEW_MODE=silent` in the operator's shell to pre-approve all cross-boundary writes (useful for batch / scripted workflows).

The boundary is enforced at the helper level — every cross-boundary writer (`ideas_surface.py`, future discovery-mining, future seed-pass) reuses the same primitive, so the contract is consistent.

### Deep-research sub-agent (`memory-idea-researcher`)

Auto-installed at `.claude/agents/memory-idea-researcher.md`. Read-only allowlist: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `WebFetch`. Caller-supplies-inline-rubric pattern (same as `evaluator` from plan #3).

Dispatched after `ideas_incubator.py` creates the skeleton — fills the 3 placeholder files via 3 passes (in order of cheapness):

1. **Cross-ref MemoryVault** — uses the recall engine to find existing entries related to the idea (so "did we already think about this?" is answered first). Writes to `related-memoryvault.md`.
2. **Obsidian-notes scan** — keyword + filename matches across the operator's Obsidian vault (excluding the `MemoryVault/` subtree to avoid overlap). **Read-only** — never modifies Obsidian notes. Writes to `related-obsidian.md`.
3. **Web research** — up to N web fetches on queries derived from the idea's keywords. Each fetch result becomes `research-<source-slug>.md`. Replaces the initial `research-pending.md` placeholder.

After all 3 passes (or on budget overrun), the sub-agent updates `_index.md`'s frontmatter `research_status:` field to `complete` or `partial`. **Never modifies `_index.md` body** — the body is the operator's curated reasoning surface.

### Promotion — `/memory promote idea <slug>`

When an idea is worth investing in:

```bash
/memory promote idea <slug>
# OR
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/ideas_promote.py promote <slug> \
  --vault-path ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-<account>/My\ Drive/Obsidian/MemoryVault \
  --mode silent
```

What happens:

1. **Validates** that `_idea-incubator/<slug>/` exists + `personal-projects/<slug>/` doesn't (collision guard).
2. **Moves** `_idea-incubator/<slug>/` → `personal-projects/<slug>/` via `shutil.move()` (cross-filesystem-safe).
3. **Recalculates vec-index entries** — for each file in the new location, queues delete (old path) + upsert (new path with re-embedded text). Graceful-skip if vec-index unavailable.
4. **Annotates `Ideas.md`** — finds the section whose wikilink references the slug, appends `→ promoted YYYY-MM-DD to personal-private/personal-projects/<slug>/` right after the wikilink line. **Routes through A3 boundary** (operator-initiated promotion typically passes `--mode silent`).

### Garbage collection (6-month default)

Incubator entries that go untouched accumulate. The GC pass walks `_idea-incubator/<slug>/`, reads each entry's `_index.md` frontmatter `updated:` field (fallback to file mtime), and presents an interactive prompt for entries older than 6 months:

```
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Incubator entry idle: <slug> (240 days since last update)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Action: [k]eep (defer) / [a]rchive / [d]elete (default: k):
```

- **Keep** (default + non-TTY): touches `_index.md` mtime to exit the GC window; entry re-evaluated in 6 months.
- **Archive**: moves to `_idea-incubator/_archive/<slug>/`. Preserves history but excludes from active recall.
- **Delete**: `rm -rf` the dir. Irreversible. Vec-index orphans documented as v1 tradeoff (next reindex pass cleans).

**Never silent deletion** — non-TTY contexts default every prompt to Keep. To run GC non-interactively, pipe answers via stdin from an explicit script (the operator has explicitly chosen each entry's fate).

Override the threshold via `--gc-months N`:

```bash
python3 ideas_promote.py gc --vault-path <vault> --gc-months 3
```

## Vault path resolution

The skill resolves the MemoryVault root in this order:

1. **`--vault-path <path>`** CLI arg (highest priority; overrides everything)
2. **`MEMORY_VAULT_PATH`** environment variable
3. **Config file** at `~/.config/agent-toolkit/memory.yml` (`vault_path:` key) — **documented but not yet implemented as of v0.9.0**; tracked for a future task

If none resolve, both `save.py` and `evolve.py` error out with a clear next-step message. No implicit fallback to `cwd` or `~` (prevents accidental writes to wrong directories).

## Embedding mode (v0.9.2+: local-only)

**As of v0.9.2 (2026-05-20)**, the skill embeds entries via local `sentence-transformers` only — see [ADR 0001's 2026-05-20 amendment](../explanation/decisions/0001-agent-toolkit-purpose.md#amendment-2026-05-20) for the rationale (dual-mode API + local was the v1 design; collapsed to local-only since the primary operator is a Claude Ultra subscriber without a separate API key, and modern small-to-mid local models deliver near-SOTA quality on desktop-class hardware).

Default model: **`BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`** (1024-d native; ~1.3GB on disk + ~1.5GB RAM at runtime; downloads lazily on first invocation; PyTorch MPS on Apple Silicon for acceleration). The model cache lives at `~/.cache/agent-toolkit/sentence-transformers/` — override with `AGENT_TOOLKIT_SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` env var if you need a different location.

**Model swap escape hatch:** set `AGENT_TOOLKIT_EMBEDDING_MODEL=<huggingface-model-name>` to use a different local model. Useful on low-spec hosts (e.g. `AGENT_TOOLKIT_EMBEDDING_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for the lightweight ~80MB option). The model must produce 1024-d native output to match the vec-index schema; mismatches trigger a graceful-skip with a clear stderr message + `python3 vec_index.py rebuild` migration command.

There is no API mode in v0.9.2+. The `--mode api` CLI flag exits 1 with a clear error pointing at the ADR amendment.

The embedding step is **async** for writes — `/memory save` and `/memory evolve` queue to `<vault>/_meta/embedding-queue.jsonl` synchronously (fast; never blocks the file write) and a separate drain step (`python3 vec_index.py --vault-path <vault> drain` or future idle-time hook) processes the queue + writes to the vec-index. The **recall** side (UserPromptSubmit hook) is **synchronous** — it embeds the query inline + runs vec search + grep merge within the 300ms budget. This means:

- Save / evolve always succeed even if no embedding deps are available (no sentence-transformers, no sqlite-vec, no PyTorch MPS). The queue accumulates pending work.
- Recall always returns SOMETHING — if vec search fails (no sentence-transformers, no sqlite-vec, model download failed), the grep+frontmatter path still runs and returns keyword matches.
- Drain processes the queue when deps become available — graceful-skip pattern across multiple layers (sqlite-vec / sentence-transformers / enable_load_extension).
- The queue file is operator-debuggable (`cat <vault>/_meta/embedding-queue.jsonl`) and the drain function is idempotent (re-runs on a stable queue produce the same final state).

**Offline-capable recall by default (v0.9.2+)**: with `sentence-transformers` + `sqlite-vec` installed (which `install.sh` handles by default) + a Homebrew/pyenv Python (Apple's macOS system Python disables `enable_load_extension`), the full happy path works without network access once the BGE-large model is cached. Without those deps, recall degrades gracefully to grep-only — slower-to-match but always-on.

## Troubleshooting

**`save.py` exits with `No vault path resolved`**
Set `--vault-path` or `export MEMORY_VAULT_PATH=...` before invoking. The skill refuses to guess.

**`save.py` exits with `entry already exists at <path>`**
The collision check is non-negotiable — `/memory save` never overwrites. Either use a different slug, or use `/memory evolve` to supersede the existing entry (preserves it as audit trail).

**`evolve.py` exits with `old entry status is 'superseded', not 'active'`**
You can't evolve an already-superseded entry. The supersession graph traverses outward from active state. Manual escape hatch: edit the entry's `status:` frontmatter to `active` if you really need to evolve it.

**Drain reports `skipped: N, processed: 0` with `errors: 0`**
This is the graceful-skip path: sqlite-vec is missing OR the Python build doesn't support `enable_load_extension` (Apple system Python). Workaround: install Homebrew Python (`brew install python`) or use pyenv, then `pip install sqlite-vec`. Until then, save + evolve still work; embeddings queue stays pending.

**Drain reports embedding skipped for some entries**
`sentence-transformers` wasn't available for those entries (not installed, or PyTorch MPS issue, or model download failed). The entries stay in the queue; re-running drain after `pip install sentence-transformers` (or fixing the underlying issue) will process them.

**Recall hook fires but no entries surface in the agent's context**
Check the hook's stderr line — Claude Code shows hook output in its logs. If it says `Loaded 0 ...` despite saved entries, either `MEMORY_VAULT_PATH` is unset (hook can't find the vault), `_always-load/` is empty (SessionStart hook), or no entries matched the query tokens (UserPromptSubmit hook — verify via the manual `recall.py query` invocation above).

**Recall transparency line includes `(WARNING: 500ms time budget exceeded ...)`**
The vault has grown large enough that the walk + frontmatter parse + read overrun the 500ms (SessionStart) or 300ms (UserPromptSubmit) budgets. Partial results were emitted; the hook didn't block. Mitigation: prune `_always-load/` (those are read on every session boot — keep them lean), or move stale entries to `_archive/` via `/memory evolve`.

**Recall returns "embedding unavailable" stderr but still surfaces results**
This is the graceful-skip path firing — `sentence-transformers` isn't available, so vec search short-circuits and recall falls back to grep+frontmatter-only. Results are still returned; semantic-paraphrase matches won't surface but exact-keyword matches will. Run `pip install sentence-transformers` (or `bash install.sh` without `--no-python-deps`) to restore the full pipeline. As of v0.9.2 there is no API mode to fall back to — local `sentence-transformers` is the only production path; see [ADR 0001 amendment](../explanation/decisions/0001-agent-toolkit-purpose.md#amendment-2026-05-20).

**Stop hook fired but no entries appear in MemoryVault**
Check the hook's stderr line in Claude Code logs. If it says `saved 0, inboxed N`, no HIGH-confidence patterns were detected — all candidates went to `_inbox/` for triage. Check `<vault>/personal-private/_inbox/` for the mined candidates; review + promote via `/memory save` (or `/memory evolve` to supersede an existing entry). If stderr says `MEMORY_VAULT_PATH set?`, the hook's environment didn't inherit the vault env var — set it globally in your shell config (`.bashrc` / `.zshrc`) so Claude Code's hook child processes see it.

**Idle hook never seems to fire**
The idle hook is registered on `SessionStart` (not a true idle event — Claude Code doesn't expose one). It scans for orphan `.harness/session-id-*.start` markers only when SessionStart events fire (boot / resume / clear / compact). For more aggressive coverage, set up a cron job: `*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/project; bash .claude/hooks/memory-reflect-idle.sh`. Also: the default idle threshold is 1 hour — markers younger than that are skipped (session might still be active). Override via `MEMORY_IDLE_THRESHOLD_SEC` env var for testing.

**Crashed session — what should I see?**
After Claude Code crashes mid-session: `.harness/session-id-<sid>.start` should still exist (Stop never fired, so no rename). Next time you boot Claude Code in that project: SessionStart fires, `memory-reflect-idle.sh` scans, finds the orphan past the 1-hour threshold, runs `reflect.py --route` against the crashed session's transcript, renames the marker to `.reflected`. If the marker doesn't get reflected even after waiting 1+ hour: check `MEMORY_VAULT_PATH` is set in the operator's shell config, and `reflect.py --route` requires the vault — without it, the rename doesn't happen + the marker stays for retry next session.

**Interactive `/memory reflect` doesn't prompt; goes straight to inbox**
The interactive mode requires stdin to be a TTY. If you piped output / redirected stdin / ran from a non-interactive context, `--route-mode interactive` falls back to `auto` (which sends MEDIUM to `_inbox/`). Re-run from an interactive shell or use `--route-mode silent` to auto-approve MEDIUM candidates without prompting.

**`_inbox/` is growing unchecked**
Low-signal candidates accumulate in `_inbox/` over time. There's no automatic triage — that's plan #7a part 5's `seed-pass` scope. For now, periodically: `ls <vault>/personal-private/_inbox/` to see what's piled up; for each entry, decide to `/memory save` (promote to canonical), `/memory evolve` (supersede an existing entry), or `rm` (reject). Future plans will add `/memory triage` for batch processing.

**Ideas.md write was denied (permeable-boundary)**
The A3 boundary helper denied a cross-boundary write — typically because the hook ran non-interactively (auto mode → unconditional deny) or the operator answered `n`/empty at the interactive prompt. The reflection sidecar emits a stderr warning; the idea candidate stays in the calling session's output but doesn't land in `Ideas.md`. To approve future writes without prompting, set `MEMORY_REVIEW_MODE=silent` in your shell config.

**`_idea-incubator/<slug>/` exists but research files are empty placeholders**
The `ideas_incubator.py` writer creates the skeleton; the `memory-idea-researcher` sub-agent fills the placeholders at dispatch. Until the sub-agent runs against the slug, `research-pending.md` + `related-*.md` stay as placeholders. Operator-driven triage: fill them by hand, or dispatch the sub-agent via your parent agent.

**`/memory promote` succeeded but Ideas.md wasn't annotated**
Check the promote output's `ideas_annotation:` field. Three possible values: `written` (success), `denied_or_not_found` (A3 boundary denied OR the section's wikilink doesn't match the auto-search regex — operator edited the section format manually), `no_ideas_file` (Ideas.md doesn't exist). For denied: re-run with `--mode silent`. For section_not_found: manually annotate or revert the section's wikilink format.

**GC scanned old entries but didn't delete anything**
The GC pass defaults to Keep when stdin isn't a TTY — locked design call B1.i says **never silent deletion**. To actually delete entries: run GC interactively (`python3 ideas_promote.py gc --vault-path <vault>` in your terminal) and type `d` at the prompt. For batch deletion, pipe explicit answers via stdin (`echo "d\nd\na\nk" | python3 ideas_promote.py gc ...`).

## Discovery + mining (plan #7b)

Plan #7b shipped four new sub-commands that turn the vault from a static curated store into a **living surface** — automatic indexing of installed skills, transcript backlog mining, internet skill-discovery, and adapt-don't-import judgment via the watchlist. Full architecture in [ADR 0007](../explanation/decisions/0007-memoryvault-discovery.md).

### `/memory index-skills` — personal-skills auto-indexer

Walks `SKILL.md` files across configured skill paths and writes one `kind: skill-pointer` entry per skill to `<vault>/personal-skills/<repo>/<skill-name>.md`. The agent picks these up via the normal recall hooks — surfacing *"we have a `/design author` skill"* without you re-mentioning it.

Auto-fires from the installer's post-install step (against toolkit's own `skills/` + sibling `agentic-harness/.claude/skills/`); manual re-run via:

```bash
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/index_skills.py \
  --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH" \
  --skill-path ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills \
  --skill-path ~/Antigravity/agentic-harness/.claude/skills
```

Idempotent: unchanged entries skip; version/description shifts trigger rewrite. Repo-name auto-detection walks up for `.git/` or `AGENTS.md` ancestor; override with `--repo-name <slug>` for non-git sources.

### `/memory reflect corpus` — historical transcript mining

Batched paced walk over `~/.claude/projects/*/<session>.jsonl` with skip-resume state. **Dry-run by default** — first call counts sessions + estimates candidate volume without writing entries; re-run with `--execute` after seeing scope.

```bash
# Dry-run first to see scope
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/reflect.py corpus \
  --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH"
# Then commit to the real run
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/reflect.py corpus \
  --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH" --execute --max-batches 5
```

State file at `<vault>/_meta/transcript-reflection-state.json` tracks per-session `{processed_at, message_count, memory_count, idea_count, status}`. Atomic writes; saved after every session for single-session resume granularity. Ctrl-C safe.

### `/memory discover-skills` — internet skill-discovery scan

Periodically (default weekly) fetches curated "skill-shaped pattern" sources from the internet; caches each as a dated snapshot; diffs against prior snapshot to surface new content. **Source whitelist is operator-editable** at `<vault>/personal-private/skill-discovery-sources.md`. First-run auto-seeds 4 sources in priority order: Anthropic Cookbook → awesome-claude-code → awesome-mcp-servers → awesome-llm-apps.

```bash
# Manual scan
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/discover_skills.py \
  --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH"
# Idle-hook cadence-checked variant (fires automatically; --cadence-check
# skips fetch if last_scan was within --cadence-days N — default 7)
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/discover_skills.py \
  --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH" --cadence-check
```

Cache layout: per-source dated snapshots + diff files under `<vault>/_meta/skill-discovery-cache/<slug>/`; central `state.json` for `last_scan + per-source { last_fetch, last_status, last_diff_chars }`. Diff files (`diff-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`) are the input to `/memory adapt-skills`.

### `/memory adapt-skills` — adapt-don't-import workflow

Two-pass architecture: Pass 1 (Python — `adapt_skills.py`) walks discover_skills's diff files, applies a 6-rule rubric, enriches with GitHub metadata + trustworthiness signals; Pass 2 (LLM sub-agent — `adapt-evaluator`) reads each enriched JSON, cross-references vault context, renders final HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW classification + writes watchlist entry. **Never writes to `agent-toolkit/skills/`** — adapt-don't-import is architectural (only the operator manually authors real skills).

```bash
# Pass 1: walk diffs + enrich (deterministic)
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/adapt_skills.py \
  --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH"
# Pass 2: sub-agent dispatch (interactive — operator-gated)
# Caller dispatches the adapt-evaluator sub-agent per its caller-supplies-
# inline-rubric contract; see agents/adapt-evaluator.md
```

6-rule rubric: R1 new-tool (+1) / R2 complements-convention (+1) / R3 agent-building-context (+1) / R4 names-primitive (+1) / R5 experimental-flag (-1) / R6 cross-vendor-proprietary (-2). Thresholds 3+ HIGH / 1-2 MEDIUM / ≤0 LOW.

GitHub enrichment fields: `github_owner / repo / stars / archived / last_commit_iso / license / html_url`. Trustworthiness signals: `from_trusted_org` (match against operator-editable whitelist at `<vault>/personal-private/trusted-sources.md` — auto-seeded with 18 default orgs: anthropics / google / microsoft / hashicorp / openai / github / modelcontextprotocol / huggingface / pytorch / etc.); `cross_citation_count` (mentions across the 4 discovery sources); `activity_recent` (committed in last 365d); `permissive_license` (MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD / ISC / MPL); `high_stars` (≥500) / `low_stars` (<50).

### `/memory watchlist` — review pending entries

List + interactive review + specific-slug actions on `_skill-watchlist/` entries. Promote / dismiss / defer mirrors `ideas_promote.py gc`'s never-silent-action contract.

```bash
# List all pending entries as JSON
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/watchlist_review.py \
  list --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH"
# Interactive review (defaults to skip in non-TTY)
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/watchlist_review.py \
  review --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH"
# Specific-slug actions for scripting
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/watchlist_review.py \
  promote anthropics-anthropic-cookbook some-pattern --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH"
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/watchlist_review.py \
  dismiss some-source some-pattern --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH"
python3 ~/Antigravity/agent-toolkit/skills/memory/scripts/watchlist_review.py \
  defer some-source some-pattern --until 2026-09-01 --reason "wait-for-stable" \
  --vault-path "$MEMORY_VAULT_PATH"
```

**Promote is annotation-only** — adds `status: promoted` + `promoted_at`; entry stays in place. The actual fork to `agent-toolkit/skills/<x>/` is your manual work outside this script (adapt-don't-import architectural rule). **Dismiss archives**, not deletes — moves to `_skill-watchlist/_archive/<source-slug>/` with collision-safe naming, preserves audit trail. **Defer snoozes** with `--until YYYY-MM-DD` + optional `--reason`; future passes can filter `deferred_until` to re-surface eligible entries.

### Cadence + automation

`memory-reflect-idle` hook (existing from plan #7a part 3 task 4 — extended in #7b task 3) auto-fires `discover_skills.py --cadence-check` at end of each idle pass. Self-throttles to the configured cadence (default 7 days) so the hook can fire frequently without hammering URLs. `adapt_skills.py` and `watchlist_review.py` are operator-gated for v1 — future task may add idle-hook auto-dispatch with `--limit N`.
